	<h1>Note on Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity refers to the measure of the efficiency of an algorithm in computer science. It assesses how the running time of an algorithm increases with the size of the input. The goal is to choose algorithms that remain efficient, even when dealing with larger datasets. Time complexity is expressed using Big O notation, which provides an upper bound on an algorithm's running time in the worst-case scenario. Selecting algorithms with lower time complexity is crucial for achieving efficient performance, particularly when working with substantial amounts of data. In essence, time complexity helps us understand and compare different approaches to problem-solving by quantifying their efficiency in terms of time.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> is a concept in computer science that measures how much memory an algorithm requires to solve a problem. It is concerned with the efficient use of memory resources. The notation O(n) is often used to express space complexity, where "n" represents the size of the input. In simple terms, O(n) means that the amount of memory needed by the algorithm grows linearly with the size of the input. The goal is to choose algorithms with lower space complexity, ensuring optimal use of memory, especially when dealing with larger datasets. Understanding space complexity is crucial for designing efficient programs that manage memory resources effectively, contributing to overall system performance.</p>
