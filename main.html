	<h1>Note on Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>information about Time Complexity, including the words 'Time complexity' and 'efficient.'</p>
	<p><b>Space complexity</b> is a concept in computer science that measures how much memory an algorithm requires to solve a problem. It is concerned with the efficient use of memory resources. The notation O(n) is often used to express space complexity, where "n" represents the size of the input. In simple terms, O(n) means that the amount of memory needed by the algorithm grows linearly with the size of the input. The goal is to choose algorithms with lower space complexity, ensuring optimal use of memory, especially when dealing with larger datasets. Understanding space complexity is crucial for designing efficient programs that manage memory resources effectively, contributing to overall system performance.</p>
