	<h1>Note on Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity in computer science is like figuring out how long it takes to do a task as the task gets bigger. It helps us compare different ways of doing things and see which is faster. We use "Big O notation" to describe this, and the goal is to pick ways that stay quick even when dealing with a lot of stuff. It's like comparing recipes to find the fastest way to bake more cookies without taking forever.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> is about how much memory a computer program needs as it works on a task. Just like with time complexity, we want to be efficient. It's like organizing your closet to use as little space as possible while still getting the job done. We use "Big O notation" to talk about it, aiming for algorithms that use memory wisely, especially when dealing with a lot of data.</p>
